Assignment: Create A RSS feed aggregator on MEAN STACK.

Create a CRUD operation where it takes the URL of the feed and stores it in the DB.


Create 3 components:
1. Form Component - This will be used to add the RSS feed url into the DB.
2. Table Component -  This component will display the list of url saved to the DB.
3. List Component -  This component will display the content of the RSS feed url (this data is updated daily/weekly/monthly).

Store the data that is sent from the RSS feed to the DB.
- This list needs to be updated when there is a change in the RSS feed.

Component Hierarchy:
App Component -> Form Component
App Component -> Table Component
App Component -> List Component

NOTE: Everything on the page should update realtime. i.e: I do not want to refresh the page to get the updated details.

Upload your code to github and revert with the link to this email.
